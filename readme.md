# Iris Speciation Project
## Using k-means and single-linkage to suggest species boundaries on the classic Iris dataset
This work was university coursework. We were given set steps to undertake, each step of my Jupyter Notebook corresponds to one of these.

Though this analysis is far from groundbreaking (it is in fact the textbook example) I am happy with my code in it. Our final task was to write our own code for single linkage clustering. Many tutorials for single-linkage clustering involve a redrawing the distance matrix of all clusters after every clustering operation. However, as single linkage is based on single links (ie, the distance between single plots in differing clusters), no new information is generated by this redrawing. 

I think my recognition of this, and the class based implementation of all other functions, makes for more readable code.
